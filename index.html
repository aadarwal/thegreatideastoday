  <!----  <p style="font-size: 18px;"> I think the point geunuinely is that you dont just not want box yourself into ideological places but you want to consider good ideas seriously for the sake of those ideas, rather than the repeated stuff that gets regurgitated a lot. 
        This would obviously expose yourself to a bunch of noise, but hopefully the point is that it will both help in developing some send of an idea of trends and taste, but more so just the general ability to have a sense for a signal after that. 
        This is hard to do I guess, but a definite goal that needs to be brought up. And so regardless of the nature of these ideas, I would like to assume that these are the ones that are genuinely worth thinking about. Sort of like the beyond smart 
        area of philosophical thought. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Another thing is that i think people look at this stuff as a kind of reading as an individual... like oh you have quoted Arendt here so you must side with her conception of banality of evil. That is not the idea here. I think these conceptions 
        of Arendtian or Nietzchean are as archaic as the hyperspecialized kinds of fields that we seem to have boxed ourselves into the general world, and the emphasis here really is a sort of trending ability towards the analysis of history to bring forth atleast a resemblence of what the 
        next reshaping of the value system of the world would look like if one is even needed. </p>

        The inward turn also seems to have done something without a doubt, but beyond just that i think the kind of thing that i have come to realize here is that there is reallty something that can and must come out of these fields of thought. 
        How and why does someone just turn these things away on the face value that they are intellectual fashions? That seems like a bit of a problem. This general consensus of truth seeking seems to converge in both directions towards the same thing. 
        I want to go out on a limb here and say that there genuinely is something great about being a wretched nature. How can you just be perfect and great? You want to live as God? Why? How? Where does that even get you. In fact not just that - why does that even get you to certain places? 
        Maybe there is some problem with writing in a manner that is so just tied down to and bogged down by names - not sure why and how people do this but maybe that is a kind of thing that really need to be escaped. But why? Whats the point of that? I am a but confused here. 
        Also genuinely am a bit concerned about the ability of people to just take these things and impose that as the natural truth- the kind of things that LLMs seem to be doing. IMO this is without a doubt just really dangerous for sure. 
        How do you get your writing to get read then? Why tf would you even want that to get read? Clearly i write for myself but at the same time i want that kind of stuff to be out there for a more general audience in the same way that others writings have been accessible to me.
        this kind of stuff increases randomness and seems to be in the long run a good contributor of innovation. 
        what is the goal of this whole market intelligence thing? -->

    What are the ways that the mediums here have changed? Some of the good ideas are also a lot of video/ multimedia content, so what does one do about that?
